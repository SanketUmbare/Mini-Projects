   - **Description**: Checks the internet connectivity of your device by pinging a reliable website (e.g., Google).
   - **Usage**: Run the script to see if your device is connected to the internet.

### 4. **Dice Roll Simulator**
   - **Description**: Simulates the rolling of a dice, generating a random number between 1 and 6.
   - **Usage**: Run the script to roll the dice, and the output will be a random number between 1 and 6.

### 5. **Dictionary**
   - **Description**: A simple dictionary that stores words and their meanings, allowing the user to look up definitions.
   - **Usage**: Input a word to get its definition or add new words and meanings to the dictionary.

### 6. **Email Slicer**
   - **Description**: Extracts the username and domain from an email address.
   - **Usage**: Input an email address to see its components separated into username and domain.

### 7. **Email Sender**
   - **Description**: Sends an email from your account using SMTP. The script can be configured to send emails to one or more recipients.
   - **Usage**: Configure your email credentials and run the script to send an email.

### 8. **Loan Payment Calculator**
   - **Description**: Calculates the monthly payments on a loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and loan duration.
   - **Usage**: Input the loan details, and the script will return the monthly payment amount.

### 9. **Password Generator**
   - **Description**: Generates a random, secure password based on user-specified criteria (e.g., length, inclusion of numbers and special characters).
   - **Usage**: Run the script, specify the desired password length and complexity, and get a generated password.

### 10. **QR Code Generator**
   - **Description**: Generates a QR code from a given input string (e.g., URL, text).
   - **Usage**: Input the data you want to encode, and the script will create a QR code image file.

### 11. **Quiz**
   - **Description**: A simple multiple-choice quiz game that tests your knowledge on various topics.
   - **Usage**: Run the script and answer the questions; the script will track your score.

### 12. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**
   - **Description**: Implements the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where you play against the computer.
   - **Usage**: Run the script, choose your move, and see if you can beat the computer.

### 13. **Scheduled Email Sender**
   - **Description**: Sends an email at a scheduled time, automating email delivery.
   - **Usage**: Set the desired time and email details in the script, and it will send the email at the specified time.

### 14. **Web Scraper**
   - **Description**: Scrapes data from a website and processes the information (e.g., retrieving and printing headlines from a news site).
   - **Usage**: Specify the URL and the data you want to scrape; the script will output the results.

### 15. **Word Replacer**
   - **Description**: Replaces a specific word in a text file with another word, useful for bulk text editing.
   - **Usage**: Input the file path, the word to replace, and the new word; the script will update the file accordingly.

### 16. **Leap Year Checker**
   - **Description**: Checks if a given year is a leap year or not.
   - **Usage**: Input a year, and the script will tell you whether it is a leap year.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SanketUmbare/Mini-Projects.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Mini-Projects
   ```

3. **Run a Project**:
   Each project is a standalone script. You can run any of them by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python <project_name>.py
   ```
   Replace `<project_name>` with the name of the script you want to run, e.g., `Calculator.py`.
